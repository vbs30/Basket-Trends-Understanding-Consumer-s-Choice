# Basket-Trends-Understanding-Consumer's-Choice

Basket Trends: Understanding Consumer's Choice is a valuable data mining technique used in retail to explore customer purchase behavior and uncover relationships 
between products frequently bought together. This proposed work uses Market Basket Analysis to understand what products customers tend to buy together when shopping. 
By analyzing this data, retailers can improve their marketing strategies, arrange products on shelves more effectively and increase sales by offering complementary 
products to customers. The goal is to gain insights that help businesses make smarter decisions to enhance the shopping experience and increase customer satisfaction.
